# Cluster Computing with Web Monitoring System.
This is a architecture for Distributed Cluster Computing for dividing a task , computing them in different computers in network and adding them at last.
 With the advancement of new technologies , computer are getting faster but there is a limit. So , for achieving high performance computing we can use multiple cheap computers to perform a single task. From this we can obtain parallelism in the task and can achieve supercomputing power.

This project contains both build version and Netbeans Project for the System.
#For using in Netbeans : 
 Use the link https://github.com/concept-inversion/Web_portal_Cluster.git for cloning it.
 
 # For running it:
   Requirements :
     JRE should be pre-installed.
     
   Running it:
   1. First of all , run the jar file from the worker folder. It runs the client which will perform works provided by the server.
   2. Now, run the jar file from the Cluster Start folder. It runs the main server which provides a GUI feature for using the              system.
